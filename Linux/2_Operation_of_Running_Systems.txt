#switch to different target
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target 
#Note: this doesn't change the default target
#if we reboot it will take to the default target i.e multi-user.target

#Other targets - if the root user password is not set, you can't use these targets

#Install, configure and troubleshooting bootloader
One of the first program that loads up when we power up a coputer, it's called a boot loader.
one purpose of the boot loader is to start the linux kernal, which is the core part of the operating system.

The most popular boot loader on linux is GRUB - grand unified boot loader.

#Generate Grub configuration file
#On a system configured to boot through BIOS like this one is, we would use a command that looks like this.
-o is to write the configuration to specific file.
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg 

#If you are on a system that uses EFI fr booting
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grub.cfg

#When a computer boots through BIOS mode,the computer looks for the boot loader at the very beginning of the disc.
That means we need to place GRUB in that area, the first few sectors of that disc.

First we need to know which disc we should install GRUB to.
There is a command that will show us all the block devices.

lsblk
From the out put we can see that SDA1 is where the boot partition is installed on this particular machine
So GRUB should be installed on the first sector of that disc.

#Install GRUB
grub2-install /dev/sda

#System booting theough EFI, computers booting this way don't look for the boot loader on the first few sectors of a disc.
so instead they are going to look for the boot loader in a file stored on a special boot partition

#you can use below command to automatically place the boot loader files in their proper location.
dnf reinstall grub2-efi grub2-efi-modules shim 

#make some configuration changes to the grub boot loader 
if we want to make changes to the settings for GRUB, there is a particular file that we can edit, and it requires root privilages to edit that file.

sudo vim /etc/default/grub

#Use scripting to automate system maintenance tasks

#manage the startup process and services 
#Edit service file 
sudo systemctl edit --full sshd.service

#Revert changes to service file 
sudo systemctl revert sshd.service 

#To see the status of the service 
sudo systemctl status sshd.service 

#To stop a service 
sudo systemctl stop sshd.service 

#To start a service 
sudo systemctl start sshd.service 

#Restart service 
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service 

#Reload service - not all applications supports reload 
sudo systemctl reload sshd.service 

sudo systemctl reload-or-restart sshd.service 

#Disable automatic start up at boot time 
sudo systemctl disable sshd.service 

#Enable service 
sudo systemctl enable sshd.service 

#To check if service is enabled.
sudo systemctl is-enabled sshd.service 

#Enable and start 
sudo systemctl enable --now sshd.service 

sudo systemctl disable --now sshd.service 

#Masking 
sudo systemctl mask atd.service 

sudo systemctl enable atd.service 
sudo systemctl start atd.service 

sudo systemctl unmask atd.service 

#list all the services available
sudo systemctl list-units --type service --all 

#Create systemd services
